bugzilla_harness is a tool for running a suite of Selenium tests using Firefox,
against a set of Bugzilla extensions and a Bugzilla instance configured for
MySQL. The Bugzilla code, along with extension code, are expected to be stored
in Git repositories. The harness creates a totally fresh installation for each
test invocation, to ensure repeatedability of test results.

A web server is needed to host the CGIs; bugzilla_harness uses lighttpd for
this purpose, as it is possible to run it without root privileges.
Unfortunately Apache *insists* on setuid() calls, even when configured to run
under the current UID.

    The following software needs to be installed and available on the system
    path (depending on operating system).

        server.

        apt-get install xvfb # Xvfb

SYNOPSIS

    The general plan is to have everything required by a test run to live under
    configuration control, and to collect any logs (including screenshots)
    during such a run. When a failure occurs, it should be easy to recreate the
    state of the failed test.

    Runs should execute automatically as part of a CI system, however the tool
