bugzilla_harness is a tool for running a suite of Selenium tests using Firefox,
against a set of Bugzilla extensions and a Bugzilla instance configured for
MySQL. The Bugzilla code, along with extension code, are expected to be stored
in Git repositories. The harness creates a totally fresh installation for each
test invocation, to ensure repeatedability of test results.

A web server is needed to host the CGIs; bugzilla_harness uses lighttpd for
this purpose, as it is possible to run it without root privileges.
Unfortunately Apache *insists* on setuid() calls, even when configured to run
under the current UID.


REQUIREMENTS

    The following software needs to be installed and available on the system
    path (depending on operating system).

    lighttpd
        Required to host the Bugzilla CGIs.

        apt-get install lighttpd ; rm /etc/rc2.d/*light* # lighttpd

    Xvfb
        On Linux, required in order to execute Firefox without a real X11
        server.

        apt-get install xvfb # Xvfb

    MySQL
        Required in order to host the Bugzilla MySQL database. Any MySQLd will
        do, as long as you have an account that can create new databases.

        apt-get install mysql-server # Needs a MySQLd somewhere
        apt-get install mysql-client # mysqladmin, mysql

    Info-Zip
        Required for unpacking cached library snapshots.

        apt-get install unzip

    Python >= 2.6
        bugzilla_harness is written in Python.

    Selenium
        The selenium.webdriver Python package is required.

SYNOPSIS

    The general plan is to have everything required by a test run to live under
    configuration control, and to collect any logs (including screenshots)
    during such a run. When a failure occurs, it should be easy to recreate the
    state of the failed test.

    Runs should execute automatically as part of a CI system, however the tool


WRITING TESTS

    Suites are written just like you'd write a unittest.TestCase, the API is
    almost identical. Various convenience methods are provided, refer to
    "pydoc bugzilla_harness.Suite" for full documentation.


RUNNING TESTS

    Here are some example approaches to running the harness.

    * Running against the latest version directly from the command line.

      This is useful for debugging a failing test, or while writing tests.
      First of all, use the "create" option to create a persistent Bugzilla
      installation. This saves a lot of time during test runs, as a temporary
      install doesn't need to be configured first.

      After "create" completes, use "run" to execute your modified tests. When
      you're done, use "destroy" to destroy the Bugzilla installation.

      $ ./bugzilla_harness.py create my_bz
      $ ./bugzilla_harness.py run --instance=my_bz -v dashboard.py
      ...
      # Test failed, so lets fix some stuff..
      $ vim my_bz/bugzilla/extensions/Dashboard/Extension.pm
      $ git commit -m "Fix bug." my_bz/bugzilla/extensions/Dashboard
      $ git push my_bz/bugzilla/extensions/Dashboard
      ...
      $ ./bugzilla_harnesss.py destroy my_bz


    * Running against a specific extension version, in isolation, from CI.

      This is useful for testing an extension at each revision from a
      continuous integration system. In this case, a shell script will probably
      wrap bugzilla_harness.py to convert the CI's parameters into a form
      useful for bugzilla_harness.py, e.g.:

      $ cat run_dashboard_isolated_test.py
      #!/bin/bash
      REV=$1 # Revision to test passed by CI system.

      ./bugzilla_harness.py run \
        --extensions=Dashboard \
        --extension=Dashboard:$REV


    * Running against a specific extension version, from CI.

      This is designed to test a specific version, but running with all other
      extension modules configured. This is useful to discover template and
      database conflicts resulting from mutually unaware extensions. In this
      mode, all extensions are checked out at their HEAD revision, except the
      one under test.

      $ cat run_dashboard_integrated_test.py
      #!/bin/bash
      REV=$1 # Revision to test passed by CI system.

      ./bugzilla_harness.py run \
        --extension=Dashboard:$REV
